# c.vim

# DESCRIPTION
This is a mirror of version 6.1.1(2014/04/21) of c.vim, from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=213

The mirror you are using may be https://github.com/vim-scripts/c.vim
but it's not the latest version

It seens that the offical github won't update as vim.org update.
Thus, this repo is for vundle\(or neobundle\) to install the latest version of c.vim

# USAGE

> Bundle "Lee-W/c.vim.git"

open vi and enter `:BundleInstall` or `NeoBundleInstall` in normal mode
